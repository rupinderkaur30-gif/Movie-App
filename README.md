# Movie-App
# Let's build Movie App
###### For this project,  a JavaScript application with a Rails API, I created a Movie app with that user can give review about it and also can add their favourite movies in their movie favorite list.

Our final models will be:

User:

- Name

Movie: 
 - Title
 - Image
 - Overview
 - Release_date
 - Rating

 Review:
 - Content
 - User_id
 - Movie_id

 Favourite:
 - User_id
 - Movie_id

 The index should be wrapped in a div classed movie-container and be made up of cards called movie-card.

 The show page should be wrapped in a div classed show.

# Usage
In order to start the server for the application, enter the following line in your terminal:

$ rails s

Next, open the file index.html in your browser and enjoy using Quarantine Movies!
