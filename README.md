# Movie-App
# Let's build Movie App
###### For this project, I created a Movie app with that user can give review about it and also can add their favourite movies in their movie favorite list.

Our final models will be:

User:

- Name

Movie: 
 - Title
 - Image
 - Overview
 - Release_date
 - Rating

 Review:
 - Content
 - User_id
 - Movie_id

 Favourite:
 - User_id
 - Movie_id

 The index should be wrapped in a div classed movie-container and be made up of cards called movie-card.

 The show page should be wrapped in a div classed show.

Your html should include this to load the font Creepster:

 [] <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
 [] <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
 [] <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Creepster&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
